This is a small application that I'm using to learn some about Backbone. Nothing fancy about it.

What I'm using for the moment:
- Rails 3.1. Not much to it, basic scaffolding, with small adaptations (return json objects on update and save, because somewhere Backbone stumbles over empty responses. Mind you that I'm picking up Rake 0.8.7 here, because the latest version was not playing nicely.
- Ruby 1.9.3. I was using 1.9.2 at first, but Webrick was crashing very often (I'm working on Windows here). While that still happens once in a while, the frequency has dropped considerably.
- Jammit, an asset packaging library for Rails ( http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/ ). At this time, I know just about enough of it to use it for my scenario.
- jQuery. Mind that for the moment, I'm not using jQuerys' templating plugin, because, as I understand it, things are changing in that area. For the moment, I'm using Underscore.js' templating.
- Underscore.js. Backbone is using it anyway, and as I stated earlier, I use its' templating features too.
- Backbone.js ... well, doh ....

Not at all interesting for you guys who have a lot of experience with Backbone. I use the project to fool around a bit with different options, and get a feel for better ways to use the library. I'm most certainly not an expert on the matter, and I don't think I'll be one any time soon :-).
